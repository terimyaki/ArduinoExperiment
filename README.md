# Measure My Resist

## Motivation
This was created to learn circuits, how to read information from an Arduino and present something useful to the user.

## What It Does
Like a multimeter, this is supposed to display the resistance of a resistor. Currently this can display the resistance calculation of a variable resistor, like a phototransistor, given a circuit with only 2 resistors, one of which is a 1K Ohm resistor. 

See image below for the diagram of my setup.

## Start It Up
This is an Electron app, so once Electron is installed in your cli, at the root file of this project, type: 
`electron .`
